# Introduction
In this report, I have selected TMDb Movie Data. I am going to answer two questions as the following: Question 1 Which are genres most popular from year to year? Question 2 What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues? Step 1 Data Wrangling: I will load the data, and understand the data rows and columes. Step 2 Data Cleaning: I will drop data no need, duplicate and missing values. Also, l will split data in one column that have multiple values per cell. Step 3 Exploratory Data Analysis: I will answer the two questions according to the charts. Finally, I will draw a conclusion.
